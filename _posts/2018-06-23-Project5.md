title: Metis Final Project! Anomaly Detection With Unsupervised Data.
---


My final project at the Metis Bootcamp utilized Natural Language Processing techniques, and used different anomaly detection algorithms to classify abnomal behavior in twitter data. Fit an LSTM neural net to classify anomalies.

More will be added in the near future!
