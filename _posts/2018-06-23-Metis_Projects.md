title: Women Tech Women Yes! Optimizing placement of Street Teams
---

My first data science project in the Metis bootcamp was a team project, for which I worked with my partner Amy Zhou.  

We were given some fascinating and extensive MTA data, and our task was to find and demonstrate some use for an organization called WomenTechWomenYes(or WTWY for short)... All within 4 days.

WomenTechWomenYes is a fictitious non-profit organization that encourages females to pursue careers in technology.

So my partner Amy and I worked together to answer the question, How can we optimize the placement of WTWY's marketing street teams to collect signatures for their upcoming annual summer Gala?

We used Data from 2014 to 2017 during the period May 1st through May 14th, since this is the time period the WTWY team is available to market the annual gala.

Our approach was to find the most populated stations and as well as stations close to areas with a high concentration of female workers, tech hubs as well as find the distances between stations to optimize the route taken by the street teams.

title: Loan Classification! Classifying Whether Someone Who Was Accepted For A Loan Will Pay It On Time.
---

My third data science project used a kaggle dataset for a loaning company with x features, where I cleaned and classified if a person with given characteristics would pay a loan on time or not using a ensemble method. I then built a flask app to showcase the classification algorithm.
