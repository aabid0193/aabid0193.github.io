title: Loan Classification! Classifying Whether Someone Who Was Accepted For A Loan Will Pay It On Time.
---

My third data science project used a kaggle dataset for a loaning company with x features, where I cleaned and classified if a person with given characteristics would pay a loan on time or not using a ensemble method. I then built a flask app to showcase the classification algorithm.

More will be added in the near future!
